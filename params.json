{"name":"Livedate","tagline":"Visual date picker script. ","body":"# DateInput\r\n\r\nVisual date picker script. Very compact at under 2KB minified and gzipped.\r\n\r\nDeveloped and customized/optimized for inclusion with Wedge plugins by John \"live627\" Rayes.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nIn your Wedge plugin, add the script file (obviously) and add some seperate JS like so:\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nadd_js('\r\n\tvar\r\n\t\tdays = ' . json_encode(array_values($txt['days'])) . ',\r\n\t\tdaysShort = ' . json_encode(array_values($txt['days_short'])) . ',\r\n\t\tmonths = ' . json_encode(array_values($txt['months'])) . ',\r\n\t\tmonthsShort = ' . json_encode(array_values($txt['months_short'])) . ';');\r\n\r\n\t?>\r\n```\r\n## Changelog\r\nFilesizes were computed using Packer (in Wedge) and gzipping the file.\r\n\r\n    0.2 (30 April 2012)\r\n    ---\r\n    * Optimise the code for an even smaller bytesize\r\n    ! Combine two `unbind` statements into one\r\n    - Remove references to `self`, as they were unnecessary\r\n\r\n    0.1 (01 April 2012)\r\n    ---\r\n    * Down to 1.82 KB from the original ~3.5 KB.\r\n    - Remove almost all public methods, and made the rest private (maybe three\r\n      or four were necessary for successful operation).\r\n    + Add some keyboard shortcuts, to resemble the UI widget somewhat.\r\n    - Remove all callbacks.\r\n    * Reformat functions to be variable declarations.\r\n    ! Max and min did not limit the date selectors properly.\r\n    * Use as few queries as possible, since querying the document all the time\r\n      isn't the cheapest way to do things. We're all for speed here, right?\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nThis work is based on [jQuery Tools Dateinput](http://flowplayer.org/tools/form/dateinput/).\r\n\r\n## Legal\r\n\r\nThis work is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Use the scroll wheel to change months.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
